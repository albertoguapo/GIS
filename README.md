# GIS Analysis



Welcome to the GIS Analysis repository! This project explores the principles and applications of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and spatial data analysis.

Overview

Geographic Information Systems are essential for managing, analyzing, and visualizing spatial data. This repository contains tools and examples that demonstrate how to work with geospatial data, create interactive maps, and conduct spatial analyses.

Features

* Data Visualization: Techniques to visualize spatial data using libraries like Folium and Matplotlib.
* Spatial Analysis: Methods for analyzing geographic patterns and relationships, including proximity analysis and overlay operations.
* Data Management: Tools for importing, cleaning, and processing geospatial data with GeoPandas.
* Interactive Mapping: Create dynamic maps that allow users to interact with data layers.

  
Technologies Used

* Python: Main programming language for analysis and visualization.
* GeoPandas: For handling geospatial data.
* Folium: To create interactive maps.
* QGIS: For advanced GIS operations and visualizations.

  
Getting Started

1. Clone this repository.
